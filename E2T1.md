The chart here illustrates the trend in the unemployment rate in urban and rural areas of Australia recorded for four quarters of the year 2012.
Overall, the unemployment rate in urban areas has increased whereas, in the rural areas, it has decreased. There were some fluctuations but, by the end of the year, the unemployment rate in both areas was at 5%.
The percentage of people that lost their jobs in urban areas increased for the first half of the year and, it went from 2% to 4%. In the next quarter, there was a sharp decline and the value has returned to 2%. In the last quarter, there was a sudden rise in the unemployment rate, and the figure finally stopped at 5% by the end of 2012.
On the contrary, in rural areas, the unemployment situation improved for the first half of the year, and the numbers have dropped below 5%. The unemployment percentage remained around this figure for the later half with some very minor fluctuations in between.
