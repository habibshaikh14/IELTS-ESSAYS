The diagram illustrates the various stages of a honey bee's life. It describes the stages involved from their birth to their maturity.

Overall, the life cycle of a honey bee takes about 34 to 36 days. The majority of the time is spent inside their eggs. There are a total of four stages in their life cycle.

In the beginning, the honey bee is inside an egg which takes about ten days to hatch. After the eggs are hatched, the honey bee stays inside the hatched egg for the next five days. Once they are out of their eggs, they grow very slowly for the next seven days.

In the next nine days, these honey bees will grow up to three folds and will transform into young adults. These young adult honey bees take about four days to become mature and reproduce. After maturity, the female honey bee lays 1 or 2 eggs every three days.
