The diagram illustrates the process of converting solar energy to heat energy. It demonstrates how a solar panel is made and can be used to generate electricity for our domestic needs.

Overall, the sonar panel described in this diagram can be used to heat water or air. This will save the electricity required to carry out these operations.

We need an empty box with a transparent top. The box has an inlet and an outlet on the two opposite sides to carry air or water. We can keep the box empty or place a water pipe, attaching it to the inlet and outlet of the box.

The working of the box is very simple. The sun rays carrying heat energy hits the box through the transparent top that warms up the entire box. If we pass cool air from one end, then we will be receiving warm air from the other end. Similarly, to heat the water, we can pass it from one end that flows through the pipe placed inside the box, and warm water comes out of the outlet.
