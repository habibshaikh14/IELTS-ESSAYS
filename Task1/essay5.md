The diagram illustrates the working of neurons and describes the functions performed by each part. It shows us how messages are transmitted in our body and how two neurons communicate.

A neuron contains four major components (Cell body, Dendrites, Axon and Terminal buttons). The Cell body is at the head of the neuron and is also called soma. On the head, there are hair-like branches that receive messages from other cells called Dendrites.

A long tail is attached to the head, called Axon. This component carries the messages received at the head to other neurons, muscles or glands. The message gets transferred as an electrical signal called an action potential. The Axon of some neurons is covered with a Myelin sheath that helps in speeding the signal transmission. These messages reach the terminal buttons or the foot of the neuron that form junctions with other cells.

Overall, whenever a message is to be transmitted to any part of the body using the nervous system, these neurons are the building block of it. They pass on the message or command from one neuron to the other that eventually appropriate function is carried out by the body.
