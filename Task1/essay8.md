The two diagrams give us information about the design of a machine for generating electricity from wave energy and tell us about the places where these machines can get placed.

A wave-energy machine operates with the help of water waves generated in seas or oceans. The device has two chambers, one for the airflow and one for the water flow. The lower chamber has an opening from where water is pushed inside, resulting in an increase in the water level. The increasing water level pushes the air in the upward direction and creates an airflow.

The machine has two turbines inside it, which will rotate when there is air flowing through them. When the air from the bottom is pushed upward, the turbines start rotating and give power to the elctricity generator. There is also an air inlet present at the top of the machine from where the air gets sucked into the machine by the rotating turbine. This air will then push the water out of the machine.

The machines have different outputs depending on the positions they are placed. If they are placed near the shore where small waves are generated, it results in lower output, but it has lower installation costs. If they are placed away from the seashore, they get larger and fiercer waves which give higher energy outputs, but installation costs will increase too.

Overall, the machine primarily generates electricity using a renewable energy source that is sea waves and emit zero pollution into the environment. However, the installation costs of these machines increase if we want higher energy outputs.
