The graphs illustrate the proportion of local and overseas students enrolling in the Australian Universities during ten years.

Generally speaking, there has been a steady growth in the total number of university students(overseas and local). The total number of overseas students had increased by four folds over the ten years whereas, the local student count has also doubled.

The total number of overseas students present in the university and the number of overseas students commencing into the university went hand in hand throughout the observed duration. At the start of the decade, there were 20000 total students and about 10000 newly enrolled students, which increased to 80000 total students and 40000 newly enrolled ones by the end of the decade.

On the other hand, the total number of local students went from 400000 to 600000 in about seven years, after which it reached a saturation point and did not change much in the next three years. On the contrary, the number of local students commencing into the universities remained stagnant throughout the ten years at about 200000 students.
