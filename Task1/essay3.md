The diagram illustrates the various stages involved in the process of making carbonated drinks.

Overall, there are five main stages in this process (Water Cleaning, Heating Evaporation and carbonation, Mixing, Filtering and filling, and Packaging).

The process starts with the Water cleaning stage, where raw water is filtered and mixed with the water softener and chemicals. This solution gets pumped into the second stage for heating and carbonation. The water is heated for evaporation using electric heaters and then passed through the cooling pipes into the carbonation chamber, where carbon dioxide gets added.

This carbonated solution gets transferred through a long tube into the mixing tank, where colour, syrup and flavours are added and mixed into the solution. The solution is now ready to be filled up into cans and bottles; by passing through to a filtering stage where different quantities are filled into different containers. Once the bottles and cans are ready, they are packed into boxes and transported to the supermarket.
