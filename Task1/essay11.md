The diagram is used to describe the facilities provided in the student room of an Australian university. They highlight the difference in accommodations for a one-person room and a two-person room.

Looking from an overall perspective, it is clearly evident that the plan for two people will provide a lot of extra features than the single person room. However, the two-people room is quite expensive as compared to the other.

The student room for two individuals consists of two beds, one bathroom and two study desks. It costs about 350 dollars per week and includes extra features like bookshelves, cupboards, tables and chairs. The dimensions of the room are 6 meters in length and 4 meters in width. It also includes basic facilities like television, sink, stove and microwave.

The single-person room on the other hand, will cost 200 dollars for a week and consists of a single bed, bathroom and a study desk. The room is a bit smaller when compared to the other one that is 6 meters in length and 2.5 meters in width. However, it provides all the basic facilities that are provided with the two-person plan.
